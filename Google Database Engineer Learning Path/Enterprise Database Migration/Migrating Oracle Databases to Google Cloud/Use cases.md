# Dev/Test
> Enables building and testing on cloud solutions
## Sandbox Testing
● Try new features and functionality (e.g., Multitenant)
● Integration with Google Cloud (BigQuery, ML, Containers) 
● Modernization and migration testing

## Application Development
● Increased productivity for application developers
● Flexible resource allocation 
● Iterate faster

## Patching and Upgrades
● Upgrades (12c, 18c, 19c) 
● PSUs, RUs, RURs, and critical one-off patches 
● Zero or Near-zero downtime patching and upgrade testing


# Disaster Recovery
## On-premises to Google Cloud
● Combining Google Cloud native cloud features and Oracle functionalities
● Platform for migration of applications to Google Cloud
● Backup databases to Cloud Storage; restore to Bare Metal Solution

## Cross-Region
● Protection against failure in a single region 
● Zero or near-zero downtime patching and upgrade testing 
● Ensures governance and business continuity

## Audit and Testing
● Periodic testing of regular disaster recovery activities 
● Instantiate and validate backups on a regular basis


# Backup/Recovery
## Centralized Backups
● Reduce backup administration costs 
● Automate backups to remote site 
● Take advantage of deduplication and incremental backups


## Data Lifecycle Management
● Reduce backup costs by leveraging long-term storage classes
● Storage classes: Standard, Nearline, Coldline, Archive


## Lifecycle Conditions
● Age: This condition is satisfied when an object reaches the specified age (in days) 
● As objects age, move them to another storage class or delete

# Migrate Production

## Migration Strategies 
● Shift infrastructure and apps from on-premises and migrate them as-is into the cloud
● Modernize your traditional on-premises applications by rebuilding them in the cloud


## Assess and Plan
● Determine use cases, explore migration solutions, and choose what migration journey is right for you 
● Develop a detailed migration plan with tools, solutions, or partners 


## Migrate and Optimize
● Migrate according to your detailed plan created during the previous phase 
● After your migration, look for ways to establish operational best practices and enhance existing processes
