# Understanding API Proxies: A Simple Guide

Welcome to the world of APIs! If you're just starting, you've chosen a great time to learn. This guide will walk you through a fundamental concept in modern application development: the API proxy.

## 1. Introduction: The Helpful Intermediary

At its core, a proxy is simply an "intermediary acting on behalf of something or someone else." The key idea is that a requester doesn't need to know anything about the eventual provider of a service, and the provider doesn't need to communicate directly with the original requester.

Think of a busy office with a receptionist. When you call the main line, you make your request to the receptionist (the proxy). The receptionist finds the right person or department (the provider) to handle your request. From your perspective, you only ever dealt with the receptionist; you don't need to know the complex inner workings of the office. Likewise, the office worker who fulfills the request only needs to deal with a standardized request from the receptionist, not hundreds of different callers with unique quirks. This middle layer makes everything smoother and more organized. Now, let's see how this powerful concept applies to the world of APIs.

## 2. What Exactly is an API Proxy?

An **API proxy** is a managed "facade" or an abstraction layer that sits in front of your backend services. Its primary job is to decouple the API that developers consume from your backend services, shielding those apps from backend code changes and the complexity of your backend systems. The application developer doesn't connect directly to the backend; instead, they connect to the API proxy.

This separation is incredibly powerful and leads to a key insight for anyone building or managing APIs:

As you make backend changes to your services, apps continue to call the same API without any interruption.

This ability to change the backend without breaking the applications that depend on it is one of the main reasons API proxies are so valuable.

## 3. The Power of Decoupling: Why Use an API Proxy?

You might wonder, "Why add an extra network hop? Doesn't that just slow things down?" While there can be a tiny amount of added latency, the benefits of using an API proxy layer almost always outweigh the costs. The advantages can be grouped into two main categories: gaining control and unlocking flexibility.

### Gaining Control and Insight

- **Enforce Security:** A proxy can verify security tokens and enforce security policies to protect backend services from unauthorized access. This is crucial for APIs exposed to the internet, allowing you to add a security layer to backends that may not have it built-in and even remove sensitive fields before returning responses.
- **Manage Traffic:** A proxy can implement rate limiting to prevent backend services from becoming overloaded with too many requests. It can also serve frequently requested data from a cache, which reduces unnecessary traffic to the backend and improves response times.
- **Collect Analytics:** By sitting in the middle, a proxy can capture detailed analytics data for every single API call. This provides invaluable insight into API usage, performance, and potential issues, even for backend services that don't capture this data themselves.

### Unlocking Flexibility and Innovation

- **Modernize Without Breaking Things:** You can completely change your backend services—moving them from a data center to the cloud or refactoring them into microservices—without affecting the applications that consume your API. The proxy handles the changes, so the consumer-facing API remains stable.
- **Simplify for Developers:** A proxy can shield app developers from the complexity of backend systems. It can even combine multiple services, including third-party services, into a single, easy-to-use API, making the developer's job much simpler.

Now that we understand _why_ API proxies are so useful, let's take a look at _how_ they actually work.

## 4. How an API Proxy Works: A Look Inside

An Apigee API proxy is composed of two main parts that manage the flow of an API request from a client app to a backend service and back again: the `ProxyEndpoint` and the `TargetEndpoint`.


| Component          | Role and Key Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ProxyEndpoint**  | This is the "front door" that faces the client application. Its main jobs include:<br>• Defining the API proxy's URL that apps will call.<br>• Handling security checks, quota checks, and rate-limiting.<br>• Parsing and validating the incoming request from the app.<br>• Building the final response to send back to the app, or blocking the request entirely if it violates a security policy. |
| **TargetEndpoint** | This is the "connection" that interacts with the backend service. Its main jobs include:<br>• Defining the address (URL) of the backend service to call.<br>• Building the request that will be sent _to_ the backend.<br>• Specifying connection settings like timeouts.<br>• Handling and validating the response received _from_ the backend.                                                      |

These two endpoints provide a clear separation of concerns, allowing you to manage the client-facing and backend-facing parts of your API independently.

## 5. Adding Superpowers with Policies

Much of the powerful functionality we've discussed—like security, rate-limiting, and data transformation—is added to an API proxy using **policies**. A policy is a pre-built module that implements a specific, limited management function without requiring you to write any new code. Apigee provides a robust set of over 50 pre-built policies, and for even greater flexibility, you can write custom scripts (like JavaScript) to extend API functionality.

Policies allow you to easily and reliably add common capabilities to your API. Examples of functionality that policies provide include:

- Security (e.g., verifying API keys or OAuth tokens)
- Rate-limiting (e.g., controlling the number of requests an app can make)
- Transformation (e.g., converting data from XML to JSON)

By attaching policies to the request and response flows in the ProxyEndpoint and TargetEndpoint, you can precisely control your API's behavior.

## 6. Summary: Your New Understanding

To sum it up, an API proxy is a powerful intermediary that provides a stable and managed interface for application developers. By decoupling front-end applications from back-end services, an API proxy gives you a tremendous amount of control, security, and flexibility. This allows you to modernize your systems and innovate freely without disrupting the developers and applications that rely on your APIs.

Understanding the API proxy is a foundational concept in the full lifecycle of modern API management.
